                    SchoolYard (SY) thrives to bring the social, educational, and networking interactions 
                    normally taken place in physical schoolyards to distant-learning platforms worldwide.

                    SchoolYard also functions as an effective communication platform for in-person schools 
                    by streamlining the discussion channels between school administrators, parents and 
                    students as well as among students themselves. SchoolYard creates a safe 
                    environment optimized for students to organize or join school activities.
